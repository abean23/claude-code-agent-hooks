# Submission Timeline

## Work Completed Within 6-Hour Mark

**Technical Implementation:**
- Complete pipeline architecture (agent, hooks, validation, orchestration)
- IRProcessor.py with 3-layer validation
- All Python modules (validation_orchestrator.py, manifest_generator.py, summary_generator.py)
- EdgeCaseAgent definition and configuration
- Stop hook implementation with bounded correction
- Example division.py and test scenarios
- All configuration files, schemas, and requirements

**Initial Documentation:**
- README.md complete structure and content
- PLANNING.md sections 1-7 drafted
- main-guide.md sections 1-3 complete, sections 4-8 outlined

## Work Completed After 6-Hour Mark

**Documentation Expansion:**
- README.md: Simplified Mermaid diagram, polished opening sentence
- main-guide.md: Mermaid diagram
- PLANNING.md: Enhanced section 2 (Developer Needs Analysis)
- main-guide.md: Added EdgeCaseAgent complete definition to section 4.1
- main-guide.md: Added 6 code excerpts from IRProcessor.py with explanations
- main-guide.md: Added complete hook orchestration code to section 4.3
- main-guide.md: Merged sections 5 & 6, added correction guard implementation
- main-guide.md: Added outcome classification with code to section 6

## Known Limitations (If Given More Time)

- Section 4.4: Would expand observability system with usage examples
- Section 5: Would expand thin pitfalls with full code examples
- Section 7: Would add concrete extension examples (Jest/JUnit patterns)
- Would add dedicated troubleshooting guide with error messages
- More context-agnostic code samples that a user could simply drop directly into their flows
